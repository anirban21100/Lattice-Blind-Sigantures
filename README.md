This repository consists of two implementations for lattice blind signatures. Clone the repository and run the main.py files to start the execution.

If the norm is out of bounds due to random sampling, the signature fails (to be in line with the paper's implementation). Please rerun it, and if the sampling of the random variable stays within limits this time, it will be run successfully.
